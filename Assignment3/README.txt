-'main.m' is the main function that calculates all the halftone images and displays the fidelity matrix for a given image. Images are saved in TIFF format.

-The halftone images of 'campus.png', 'Photo1.png', 'Photo2.png' is stored in  the folder named campus, Photo1, Photo2 respectively.

-'ord_dither.m' performs ordered ditching by calling supplementary functions('index_mat.m', 'thres_mat.m', 'change_dim.m', 'calc_halftone_dither.m', 'ord_dither.m') whose purpose is mentioned in the report.

-'err_diff.m' performs error diffusion for a given image.
